## Why this hub
- CPU-first defaults with explicit RAM/VRAM footprints and throughput.
- Consistent notebook headers, Colab badges, and measurement hooks.
- One benchmark matrix, one fixes index, clear contribution standards.

## Start here
1. Clone the repo and create a virtual environment.
2. Open a notebook in JupyterLab, VS Code, or the provided Colab badge.
3. Run the setup cell to choose CPU, Metal, or CUDA.
